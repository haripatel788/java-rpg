# RPG Game (Java)

This repository contains the source code for my text-based RPG game written in **Java**. The game was built using core programming concepts like **loops**, **conditionals**, **user input**, and basic game logic to create an interactive adventure.

## 🎮 Play the Game
You can play the full game here:
